1- minmax(a, b): This function returns a pair, in which 1st element is of minimum of the two elements and the 2nd element is maximum of 2 elements.

2- minmax(array of elements): 

This function returns similarly as 1st version. Only difference is that in this version, 
the accepted argument is a list of integers/strings among which maximum and minimum are obtained. 
Useful in cases when we need to find maximum and minimum elements in list without sorting








#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include<algorithm> 
using namespace std;


int main()
{
    

vector <int> v = { 50,3,7,18,10,65};

// print to numbers


 auto pair =  minmax_element(v.begin() , v.end()) ;

// the first element is the min 
cout << *pair.first <<endl;

// the second element is the max 

cout << *pair.second<<endl ; 


    return 0;
}
